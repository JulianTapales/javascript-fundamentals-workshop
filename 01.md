## Getting Super Powers

You can think of variables as boxes or placeholders. We can assign data to a variable, and refer to the variable name later on to get the data inside it.

```javascript
let name = "John"
console.log(name) // John
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For the following examples, we will use the keyword `let` when we create variables but we can also use `const` or `var`. There are differences between them that we will go over later on.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```

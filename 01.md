## Variables

You can think of variables as boxes or placeholders. We use the `let` keyword to create a variable. We can assign data to a variable, and refer to the variable name later on to get the data inside it.

```javascript
let age = 30
console.log(age) // 30
```

We can then use this variable instead of the data directly:

```javascript
let ageDeclaration = "Hi, I am "+age+" years old"
console.log(ageDeclaration) // "Hi, I am 30 years old"
```

In the above example, the variable age is replaced by its contents \(in this case 30\) giving the variable `ageDeclaration` the value of `Hi, I am 30 years old`

{% hint style="info" %}
The command `console.log(VARIABLE)` is used to display the variable it is given in the console. More on this later.
{% endhint %}

Variables can contain different kinds of data, like strings \(text enclosed with `"`, `'`marks\), numbers, true/false values and more. You can operate on the variables and assign them to new variables as follows:

```javascript
let age = 30
let exampleString = 'I am an example string'
let boolean = true
```

We can also combine the above values in different ways:

```javascript
let doubleAge = 2+age //32
let excitedDoubleString = 'LOOK!! '+exampleString // 'LOOK!! I am an example string'
```

Interestingly, we used the the same `+` operator, but when we were using numbers, it added them together and when we had strings, it "concatenated" them together. In other words it did different things depending on the type of data we were operating on. Something to keep in mind.

While the above types of data \(numbers, strings etc\) are more to do with individual bits of data, we have ways to work with collections of them, namely arrays and objects. An array is a list of values referable by position \(starting from 0\) and object is a dictionary style collection of values.

```javascript
let namesArray = ['John', 'Amelie', 'George', 'Cassie']
namesArray[0] // John
namesArray[2] // George

let personObject = {
    name: 'Amelie',
    age: 25,
    nationality: 'french'
}

personObject.name // Amelie
personObject.age // 25
personObject.nationality // french

```

## Functions

While you can think of variables as a placeholder for some data, you can think of functions as a small reusable program. A function often accepts some data, does something with it, and returns the result. Here is an example:

```javascript
let square = (num) => {
 return num*num
}

square(10) //100
square(2) //4
```

Notice its not that different from declaring a variable. That's because it isn't, functions are data too \(like numbers, strings etc\), so we can assign them to variables. Here, the `square` variable contains a function that accepts a number value and returns that value multiplied by itself. We can use the function by typing in the name, and giving it the values it needs separated by commas in between the parenthesis. Now instead of multiplying each variable by itself whenever we want to square something, we can use this function. Here is another one:

```javascript
let greet = (name) => {
    return 'Hello '+name+', how are things today?'
}

greet('Amelie') // Hello Amelie, how are things today?
```

In an inception like turn of events, because a function is also data, we can pass a function to another function as an argument like this:

```javascript
let applyAndSum = (value1, value2, operator) => {
    return operator(value1) + operator(value2)
}

applyAndSum(2, 3, square) // 13
```

In the above example, we defined another function that accepts three values, two numbers and one function. Inside, we apply the function to both values and add the results together. This is can be neat when working with lists for example:

```javascript
let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
let addOne = (num) => {
    return num + 1
}

numbers.map(addOne) //[2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

List has a "built in" operator called map that accepts a function. It then applies this function each item in the list and returns the resulting newly "mapped" array.

## Anatomy of a web page

Javascript is most commonly found in webpages, along with HTML and CSS. If you are not familiar with their respective roles, in general the HTML defines the elements \(buttons, input boxes..\), CSS defines what it looks like and Javascript makes it interactive.

If you right click on a webpage and select "inspect element", you will get presented with the developer tools. This shows you what underlying code is running in order to make the webpage. 

A really simple HTML page with no CSS or JavaScript could look like this this:

```markup
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

HTML consists of tags with content enclosed inside. There is an opening tag e.g `<h1>` \(short for "header 1"\) and a closing tag `</h1>` the difference being that the closing tag has a backslash before its name. Here is what the webpage looks like:

{% embed url="https://codepen.io/JulianTapales/pen/RqVeey" %}

Codepen is a website that lets people make interactive web projects. I'll use it here so that you can run the code. If we wanted to use CSS, we could do so like this:

{% embed url="https://codepen.io/JulianTapales/pen/eQWPqz" %}

When we run Javascript on a website, a webpage gives us a massive object called `document` . To see what it looks like, we can run `console.log(document)` in the terminal window of our browser to understand what is going on. If you open the developer tools in your browser window...

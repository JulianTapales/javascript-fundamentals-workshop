# Session 01

## Variables

You can think of variables as boxes or placeholders. We use the `let` keyword to create a variable. We can assign data to a variable, and refer to the variable name later on to get the data inside it.

```javascript
let age = 30
console.log(age) // 30
```

We can then use this variable instead of the data directly:

```javascript
let ageDeclaration = "Hi, I am "+age+" years old"
console.log(ageDeclaration) // "Hi, I am 30 years old"
```

In the above example, the variable age is replaced by its contents \(in this case 30\) giving the variable `ageDeclaration` the value of `Hi, I am 30 years old`

{% hint style="info" %}
The command `console.log(VARIABLE)` is used to display the variable it is given in the console. More on this later.
{% endhint %}

Variables can contain different kinds of data, like strings \(text enclosed with `"`, `'`marks\), numbers, true/false values and more. You can operate on the variables and assign them to new variables as follows:

```javascript
let age = 30
let exampleString = 'I am an example string'
let boolean = true
```

We can also combine the above values in different ways:

```javascript
let doubleAge = 2+age //32
let excitedDoubleString = 'LOOK!! '+exampleString // 'LOOK!! I am an example string'
```

Interestingly, we used the the same `+` operator, but when we were using numbers, it added them together and when we had strings, it "concatenated" them together. In other words it did different things depending on the type of data we were operating on. Something to keep in mind.

While the above types of data \(numbers, strings etc\) are more to do with individual bits of data, we have ways to work with collections of them, namely arrays and objects. An array is a list of values referable by position \(starting from 0\) and object is a dictionary style collection of values.

```javascript
let namesArray = ['John', 'Amelie', 'George', 'Cassie']
namesArray[0] // John
namesArray[2] // George

let personObject = {
    name: 'Amelie',
    age: 25,
    nationality: 'french'
}

personObject.name // Amelie
personObject.age // 25
personObject.nationality // french

```

## Functions

While you can think of variables as a placeholder for some data, you can think of functions as a small reusable program. A function often accepts some data, does something with it, and returns the result. Here is an example:

```javascript
let square = (num) => {
 return num*num
}

square(10) //100
square(2) //4
```

Notice its not that different from declaring a variable. That's because it isn't, functions are data too \(like numbers, strings etc\), so we can assign them to variables. Here, the `square` variable contains a function that accepts a number value and returns that value multiplied by itself. We can use the function by typing in the name, and giving it the values it needs separated by commas in between the parenthesis. Now instead of multiplying each variable by itself whenever we want to square something, we can use this function. Here is another one:

```javascript
let greet = (name) => {
    return 'Hello '+name+', how are things today?'
}

greet('Amelie') // Hello Amelie, how are things today?
```

In an inception like turn of events, because a function is also data, we can pass a function to another function as an argument like this:

```javascript
let applyAndSum = (value1, value2, operator) => {
    return operator(value1) + operator(value2)
}

applyAndSum(2, 3, square) // 13
```

In the above example, we defined another function that accepts three values, two numbers and one function. Inside, we apply the function to both values and add the results together. This is can be neat when working with lists for example:

```javascript
let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
let addOne = (num) => {
    return num + 1
}

numbers.map(addOne) //[2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

List has a "built in" operator called map that accepts a function. It then applies this function each item in the list and returns the resulting newly "mapped" array.

## Anatomy of a web page

Javascript is most commonly found in webpages, along with HTML and CSS. If you are not familiar with their respective roles, in general the HTML defines the elements \(buttons, input boxes..\), CSS defines what it looks like and Javascript makes it interactive.

If you right click on a webpage and select "inspect element", you will get presented with the developer tools. This shows you what underlying code is running in order to make the webpage. 

A really simple HTML page with no CSS or JavaScript could look like this this:

```markup
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

HTML consists of tags with content enclosed inside. There is an opening tag e.g `<h1>` \(short for "header 1"\) and a closing tag `</h1>` the difference being that the closing tag has a backslash before its name. Here is what the webpage looks like:

{% embed url="https://codepen.io/JulianTapales/pen/RqVeey" %}

Codepen is a website that lets people make interactive web projects. I'll use it here so that you can run the code. If we wanted to add CSS, we use the `style` tags as follows:

{% embed url="https://codepen.io/JulianTapales/pen/KrmLej" %}

When we run any Javascript on a webpage, we automatically have access to a massive object called `document` . To see what it looks like, we can run `console.log(document)` in the terminal window of our browser \(right click on the page, select "inspect element" and click the "console" tab/window button\). Along with many more attributes \(documentation of which can be seen here [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document)\), we can see a list of attributes starting with "on", like `onclick` and `onmousemove` . These are called "event handlers", values of which are triggered when the event occurs. For example:

```javascript
let doSomethingWithMouseMovementEvent = (event) => {
    console.log(event)
}

document.onmousemove = doSomethingWithMouseMovementEvent

/* Every time the mouse is moved, our function is executed and we 
    get an object like the following logged in our console:
    {
        altKey: false,
        bubbles: true,
        button: 0,
        buttons: 0,
        cancelBubble: false,
        cancelable: true,
        â€‹
        ... etc ...
        â€‹
        screenX: 613
        screenY: 598
        
        â€‹... etc ...
    }
*/
```

Try clicking the "Run Pen" button then the top right codepen icon to open the example in full. Then open the console and move your mouse on the screen to see what is logged to the console. You should see objects like the one above being displayed.

{% embed url="https://codepen.io/JulianTapales/pen/yQXWWm" %}

Note that we used the `script` tags to enclose our Javascript code. Now that we can see our event objects, we can also notice that the `screenX` and `screenY` values are different with each event. Looking up what these values are in the MDN website: [https://is.gd/NxzCMU](https://is.gd/NxzCMU), [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/screenX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/screenX) we can see that these values are the coordinates of the mouse on the screen. We can also find out after inspecting the document object as before that a `document.body.style.backgroundColor` exists, where after searching again on the MDN website for the `style` attribute\([https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style)\), we can see that by making it equal to a value like `"rgb(255, 0, 0)"` , we can set the background of the page red, like so:

{% embed url="https://codepen.io/JulianTapales/pen/YRQoVL" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that its "color" and not "colour"! This has caught me out many times in the past, if your code is not working, maybe check to see if you have mispelt this.
{% endhint %}

Now notice that when we move the mouse over the page, the whole background changes to red, and that because the text is also red, we no longer see it \(you can check its still there by highlighting it\). Now we are turning the page red every time the `onmousemove` event happens so whenever we move the mouse. Interesting, but we can do better. Remember in our earlier examples where we used the `+` operator to "concatenate" two bits of text or "strings" together? We can do that again here with the color. If we write our code like this:

```javascript
window.onmousemove = (event) => {    
    console.log(event);        
    window.document.body.style.backgroundColor = "rgb("+event.clientX+", "+event.clientY+",0)"
}
```

This code should create a new color whenever this code is run \(based on the positions of the mouse on the screen\) and assign this new color to the background of body. Lets try this out to see if it works.

{% embed url="https://codepen.io/JulianTapales/pen/qQjzJo" %}

Yes! ðŸŽ‰ðŸš€ 

It works! But we have this horrific line of code to look at:

```javascript
    window.document.body.style.backgroundColor = "rgb("+event.clientX+", "+event.clientY+",0)"
```

Especially this bit:

```javascript
"rgb("+event.clientX+", "+event.clientY+",0)"
```

I mean it's not the worst thing, but all those `+` and `,` and `"` in just the right place make it tricky to make changes without the code breaking, and it also makes it hard to see exactly what is going on. So why don't we split this long line up by using a function? Lets rewrite it like this:

```javascript
const makeRGBColor = (x, y) => {
  return "rgb("+ x +", "+ y +", 0)"
}

window.onmousemove = (event) => {
  console.log(makeRGBColor(event.clientX, event.clientY));
  
  window.document.body.style.backgroundColor = makeRGBColor(event.clientX, event.clientY)
}
```

Now things are a bit clearer! We see a function that accepts two values and "makes an RGB colour" from it. We then use this function with the mouse positions instead of the two values, and assign the result to the background style attribute of the body element. 

To summarize, we covered:

* Variables and the kinds of data they can contain
* Objects and Arrays - ways of working with collections of variables and data
* Functions - small reusable programs
* The constituent elements of a web page
* The big `document` object in the browser
* How we can get code we write to run in response to a specific event in this case `onmousemove` 
* How we changed the style of an html with Javascript

# Intro

This workshop aims to revisit the fundamental elements of programming from more of a designers perspective, helping you reason with your codes behaviour and write understandable, working software. The idea is as you learn to do this, because we are using javascript and web technology \(HTML, CSS\), you will also make considerable progress learning how to make websites and web applications which is an added plus.
